  I started my education in 1990 in office automation & career development at
  the Business Computer Training Institute in Everett, WA. In 1992 I continued
  my search for business management, but soon after stumbled upon design (an
  elective in Aldus FreeHand, which later became Macromedia, which then became
  Adobe). I fell in love with the program and that was the start of my career in
  design.

I started my education in 1990 in office automation & career development at the Business Computer Training Institute in Everett, WA. In 1992 I continued my search for business management, but soon after stumbled upon design (an elective in Aldus FreeHand, which later became Macromedia, which then became Adobe). I fell in love with the program and that was the start of my career in design.

I completed my Associates degree at Edmonds Community College in Lynnwood, WA, but felt that I needed more. Researching the 4 best schools in the United States for art and design, I applied and got excepted to the world famous Art Institute of Chicago where I completed my Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Visual Communication.

Through the coarse of my creative growth, I found one thing: There is no end to the creativity that I can provide to my clients and myself. I continue to strive creatively. I continue to feed off of my employers'/clients'/myself's enthusiasm and appreciation for my work. I enjoy increasing the exposure of my employers'/clients' messages. Through this goal, I will continue to look forward. I will continue my education in the world of design, photography, video and everything between. And, I will have fun during this education.
