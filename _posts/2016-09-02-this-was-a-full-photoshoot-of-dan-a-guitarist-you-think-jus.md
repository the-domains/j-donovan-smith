  This was a full photoshoot of Dan, a guitarist you think just plays classic
  rock with a little flare, but on the contrary - he plays classical and many
  other forms. It was amazing to watch his fingers move. This photo was to
  depict a guitarist deep in thought about his work, with the design to reflect
  what he plays.
